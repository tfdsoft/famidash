This is hard, but you ofc can do that. Guide by kando and me

how to add a brand new level to famidash's array:

1. add level in export levels.bat and .sh
2. modify SAUCE/defines/space_defines.h to add additional level
3. add text strings in SAUCE/defines/menutext2.h
4. add both string 1 and string 2 (null/0 if they dont exist) to their placement in SAUCE/gamestates/state_lvldone.h in the level text array
5. Add the parameters for your level into LEVELS/levellist.h and LEVELS/level_header.s
6. export levels and build

Also keep in mind a rom can only have limited amount of levels
