To add / edit music, edit MODULES/MODULES/music_master.dnm in Dn-FamiTracker 0.5.0.2; it's also possible to add music via FamiStudio 4.3.0..4.3.3 in the MODULES/MODULES/music_master.fms file.

When adding / editing anything in the modules, add it to the changelog and describe it in exact detail. If you edited something and didn't add it to the changelog, @alexmush will personally shit your pants.

IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR 2 PEOPLE TO WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THE .dnm, SINCE MERGING THAT IS ONE HELL OF A HASSLE.

(to do that you need to export text from both versions of the module, and manually adjust shit until it can be imported back)

You can, however, add new songs easily in FamiStudio to merge 2 diverging branches.

OPEN THE MODULE IN DN-FT 0.5.0.1 OR NEWER. 0.5.0.0 BREAKS SHIT
DO NOT USE FamiStudio 4.4.0 OR NEWER. ITS DPCM EXPORTS ARE DIFFERENT AND ARE CURRENTLY NOT SUPPORTED BY THIS SCRIPT.

.dnm modules are imported into FamiStudio after they're done, so please do not use unsupported by FS effects (full list at https://famistudio.org/doc/import/#famitracker-text-or-binary)

Paths are given to relative to the MUSIC folder, unless it begins with a /, then it's the root famidash directory


How to compile the music:
If you worked in Deeznuts-FT:
	1. Copy the song into MODULES/music_master.dnm
	2. While still in Dn-FT, export MODULES/music_master.dnm as .txt into the INTERMEDIATES folder
	3. Run the adjust_ft_txt.py script (run it anywhere)
	4. Import ONLY THE SONGS AND INSTRUMENTS YOU HAVE ADDED/MODIFIED into FamiStudio 4.3.x.
	5. Hand-correct things that FS gave warnings about.

After this, the same precautions and actions follow, no matter where you worked before:
	1. Ensure that all added songs are in MODULES/music_master.fms
	2. If you have added / modified any DPCM samples, ensure that:
		- they are properly distributed between banks
			- this can be done by right-clicking on a DPCM sample and choosing the "Auto-Assign Banks..." option with an 8KB bank size
		- every sample used in the tracks in the game is in the "dpcm" song (that's the DPCM aligner)
	3. Save the MODULES/music_master.fms module
	4. Add the songs to metadata.json5 file for the export script to include them in the game (and the sound test)
	5. Run the following command to test the music exports:
		`python3 export_wrapper.py -t [-f FAMISTUDIOPATH | -c FAMISTUDIOCOMMAND [FAMISTUDIOCOMMAND ...]] [-v]`
		If FamiStudio.dll on your system is in the PATH variable or an otherwise common installation location (this can be checked with trial and error), you should omit the FAMISTUDIOPATH, otherwise substitute it with the actual path to FamiStudio.dll on your machine.
		An equivalent to this command is running the `test_export.bat` script on Windows.
	6. Check the output of it, make sure it didn't error out midway through and gave you the following message:
		"==== Everything seems to have gone alright, you can run it for real now."
	7. If it didn't error out and it completed successfully, run the following command to do it for real:
		`python3 export_wrapper.py [-f FAMISTUDIOPATH | -c FAMISTUDIOCOMMAND [FAMISTUDIOCOMMAND ...]] [-v]`
		An equivalent to this command is running the `export.bat` script on Windows.
	8. Don't close the terminal yet! You've now got one last thing to adjust:
	9. Ensure that the /LIB/asm/famistudio_ca65.s file has the settings set as the export output dictates
	10. Test the game.
	11. If the song did not appear anywhere during the export process, refer to step 4.
	12. If the compilation errors out due to an overflow in DAT_BANK_XX, congratulations, you've run out of space! Refer to step 13.
	13. If anything odd went on in any of these steps, ping @alexmush and they'll probably respond within 48 hours (response times will vary)
